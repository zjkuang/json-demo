## Requirements
The JSON file must be
 - named `db.json`
 - located in the repository's root directory
 - on `main` or `master` branch

## How to fetch

e.g. We have in db.json
```
{
  "services": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "greeting"
    }
  ],
  "profile": {
    "name": "john"
  }
}

```
